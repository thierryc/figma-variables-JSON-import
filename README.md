# Variables Import

This Figma plugin allows you to import design tokens in the [Design Token Community Group](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) format as Figma Variables.

This plugin does not contain a fully spec-compliant parser for the DTCG format and cannot handle every single valid token file—it's just a tool we built for internal use.

The following token types are supported:

-   `string`
-   `number`, `dimension`, `duration`
-   `boolean`
-   `string`
-   Aliases to any other supported token in the same JSON and Figma file

The following are supported **only** when running a local copy of this plugin, not from the Figma Community:

-   Aliases to any other supported token in a different JSON file and Figma file, if the other Figma file has published the variables to a team library

## Setup

### Node.js

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) so you can build this project.

### Install

Then install dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Build

Then you can build.

#### Dev

To enable all features, you need to open `manifest.json` and add the following line:

```json
"enableProposedApi": true
```

Then, you can start a background build with:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

#### Production

```bash
npm run build
```

`enableProposedApi` **cannot** be used in a plugin published to the Figma community, even internal to your own organization.

### Adding to Figma

Add this plugin to Figma using "[import new plugin from manifest](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360042786733-Create-a-plugin-for-development)".
